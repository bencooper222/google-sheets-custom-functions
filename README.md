# Custom Google Sheets Functiosn Repository
## What is this?
It's a repository of handy custom Google Sheets functions. Right now, it's just a handy resource for myself - a away to add all the various ones that I create to make my life easier. I will be accepting PRs with your custom functions and if it gets big enough, I'd love to build out the project further. 

## How do I use one of these?
Google has a nice walk thorugh of it [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions). The big thing to remember is that custom functions are not autocompleted in Sheets - you have to type them out in full. 

## Why would I want to use one of these?
These functions bridge the gap between a traditional database and a basic spreadsheets. Consider someone trying to hold an event and trying to figure out their participants distance from their event: a fairly simple need. Google Sheets has no native way to do that. Google Sheets custom functions allow it to happen easily. 

## Why would I not want to use one of these?
The simple answer is that Google is a pain in the ass about using them. These functions take longer to run, have some level of rate limiting, are difficult to debug and will require a lot of copying and pasting to proper files. That said, it's usually easier than setting up a proper development environment or something more intense like an ElasticSearch cluster. 

## Contributing your functions
There's no formal procedures now but I'd love to build up a proper collection of them - submit a PR or create an issue.
